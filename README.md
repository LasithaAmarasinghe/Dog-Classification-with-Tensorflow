## Overview

* This is an end-to-end deep learning project using **Tensorflow** and **Keras**.
* A dataset of dog images is read, and then a convolutional neural network is trained to classify them by breed.
* This repository contains the code and resources necessary to build this dog classification system.

## Steps

* Loading in data with TensorFlow and Keras
* Exploring images in data with PIL (Python Imaging Library)
* Training a neural network with TensorFlow and Keras
* Looking at model error
* Improving model accuracy with dropout
* Augmenting data with Keras
* Investigating model error

## Code
You can find the code for this project here.
