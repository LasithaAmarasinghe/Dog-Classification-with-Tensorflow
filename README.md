## Overview

* This is an end-to-end deep learning project using [**Tensorflow**](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [**Keras**](https://keras.io/).
* A dataset of dog images is read, and then a convolutional neural network is trained to classify the dogs by breed.
* This repository contains all the codes and resources used to build this dog classification system.

## Steps

* Loading in data with TensorFlow and Keras
* Exploring images in data with PIL (Python Imaging Library)
* Training a neural network with TensorFlow and Keras
* Looking at model error
* Improving model accuracy with dropout
* Augmenting data with Keras
* Investigating model error

## Code
