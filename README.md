# Dog-Classification

## Overview

* This is an end-to-end deep learning project using **Tensorflow** and **Keras**.
* A dataset of dog images is read, and then a convolutional neural network is trained to classify them by breed.
* This repository contains the code and resources necessary to build this dog classification system.

## Code
You can find the code for this project here.
* [dog classification](https://github.com/dataquestio/project-walkthroughs/tree/master/dog_classification).

## Technologies/Tools

* JupyerLab / Google Colaboratory
* Python 3.10.12
* Python packages
    * Tensorflow
    * Keras
    * Pillow
    * Pandas
    * Matplotlib
     
## Data

You'll need to download the dog image dataset to follow this project:

* [dog_images.zip](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1sj62C-9WKD09-8iYSeEvXmAGQoY2oFFQ) - please unzip this file into a folder called `images`.

The data is originally from [Stanford](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).  The original dataset has many more breeds included, which you can use to extend your analysis.
